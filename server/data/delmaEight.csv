<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Who made the clothes for you?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: At that time, there were expert tailors of Indian nationality in Abu Dhabi and Qatar.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Were there specific designs for the clothes?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, in the past women used to design the so-called Hiyasa, and then a new design came and was called koloush.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: My father used to tell me that his mother used to sew men’s clothes. Do you remember that?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: No, that is before my time. When I became aware of the world, tailors came from India and were in Abu Dhabi and Qatar. But women still sewed simple clothes for children. Married women, especially in the past, always wore the so-called “Thoub” over the kandora , which is a very thin and loose piece of cloth. But after the emergence of the Hiyasa design, they became a little bit less likely to wear the “Thoub” over their clothes. As for us unmarried girls, we used to put a light piece of cloth to cover our hair which was called ""Fareed's Tear.""</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Do you remember when women used to make incense (bakhour)”?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, I remember that my mother used to make incense and it smelled more fragrant than now.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Where did the women buy the ingredients from?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Your grandfather (Khamis Al Qubaisi) used to bring them from Dubai to Delma Island. He used to bring musk, amber and oud and its price was cheap compared with nowadays. Women used to make incense using those perfumes and crushed agar wood, and they used to pound it until it became more soft and put musk or rose oil with it. They formed it to tablets, and it smells remained for a long time. Our mud houses used to absorb the smell more than now, so when we burnt incense in the house at night, next morning, we find the smell very beautiful and fragrant.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: What about the Burqa? Do you remember when you first wore it, and who used to make the burqa before?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, I remember when I put it on, I covered my face and refused to eat with my family. I did not want anyone to see me as an attempt to persuade my family not to wear it. but I did not succeed, and in the past the burqa was bigger than now. As for making it, women were the ones who made it. I remember then way my mother and Mrs. Fatima bint Hamad Al Mazrouei making it, but now Indian men are the ones who do so now.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: What about the embroidery (talli) making?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: The talli making is considered a tradition, and most women used to make it, and then it is sewn on top of the piece of cloth. Different shiny color of threads are sewn in a certain way with each other with a tool called kojaja and then it is sewn on the piece of clothing as an adornment. I learned how to make it from my mother.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Tell me about your simple daily life before. What do you remember about it?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: I remember that my mother had a cow from Oman, and my mother used to make semna (ghee) from its milk, which we use in most of our traditional food. I remember that my older sister used to bake cakes in a box of Macintosh, which is a metal box that was sold with various chocolates called ""Macintosh Quality Street Chocolates."" We were happy when it would rise in the box. I don't know how she was preparing it on the fire without an oven. One of the strange things is that we used to eat tea leaves when we were young, when our elders used to cook tea leaves, we would ask them to put it in a plate and put a lot of sugar on it and eat it. We thought it was dessert, and it should be eaten like this.</div>
<div class=""interviewHeader"">Interview with Fathi Mohammed Abdullah, Mid 50’s</div>
<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">Anecdote about when Fathi’s Role in Delma’s Archaeological Sites</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Is the fence from before they discovered the site?</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: No, this is an excellent question. There wasn’t a fence before, we discovered the pottery and saw that it was 100% an archaeological site, so we told the authorities… we didn’t have an authority for archaeology to begin with, and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism wasn’t there to begin with, but they came about with effort alhamdulillah. So, back then Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed, may God rest his soul, was in charge. We would call the agent so that he’d tell him that we had a site we needed to protect. So, one day I went there, and I was surprised to see the municipal authorities [baladiyya] and they had [mechanical] excavators and were going into the side. And of course, these were our enemies as archaeologists, we don’t want any machines in the site. Even if you go in on foot we worry.</div>



<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">Part Two</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: So, I saw this and asked, “why are you here?” And they said, “we’re going in to repair the place and build a fence.” Anyway, I made an effort alone…  I mean, there was no one to back me up, and anyone could’ve asked me “who are you? You’re just a worker.” But alhamdulillah I called, we knew this man called [indiscernible], he’s still here in Dalma. He knew Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, and I had seen him visiting the site, back in ’97. So, I called him and said, we have this important site, and he told me to call Al Ain. So, I called Mr. Mohammed Ameri Al Nayadi, he was the head of archaeology in Al Ain, and Mr. Jaber Al Merri [?] So, we had four specialists in archaeology who could see the site and if it was or wasn’t an archaeological site. And it turned out that it was, so the authorities stopped construction there. Then they wanted to work near the cemeteries, and we said there’s no problem as long as you set up a fence around it for protection and work manually without machines. And alhamdulillah, to this day we’ve been able to preserve the site.</div>
<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">The Loss of Certain Artifacts</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes. So, this was in the cemetery, and sir, you also mentioned that agriculture started over the areas, do you mean farms were built – </div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: See, Salama, all of Dalma… the historical area all the way to the His Highness’ palace, that’s all artifacts and ruins. They call this Old Dalma.   Maybe you’ve heard of Manyookh Dalma, and of Tal Abi ‘Amama, and of Sho’bet Hazeem, and of Fahaheel… all these places had artifacts. In Fahaheel, by the seaside, there was a palm tree – </div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes, it’s still there. </div> <div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: I went there, and I found Islamic pottery.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Really? Mashallah!</div><div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: But the problem was that Dalma developed quickly. No one would wait for you, they thought, “the archaeologists want to take their time.” And so, there was a race between us and between the construction. So, alhamdulillah, there were artifacts, and [we found them] in the historical area. All the way from the Old Souk to Fahaheel, this was the historical area [...] So, it’s full of artifacts. A lot of them are left and some of them were lost. For example, there were cemeteries in Tal Abi ‘Amama.</div>

<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">What Fathi Misses About his Role as an Archaeologist</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: So, sir, from 1993 to… now we’re in 2020. You’ve mentioned all these great things in Dalma, but I’m sure there are things about Dalma that have changed that you miss. What is something you miss from the old Dalma?</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: What I miss... wallahi, there isn’t anything from the old Dalma, I don’t have anything I miss from the old Dalma. In terms of the old Dalma… of course I remember the old buildings…</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: I mean from ’93 till now… for example, have the people changed or the inhabitants? For example, Rashid Al Mazroui – </div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: May God rest his soul.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: May God rest his soul. You mentioned you were close to him so, I mean, what have you noticed that you miss over the course of this period?</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Wallahi, I obviously missed Rashid as a friend and as a colleague, as an inhabitant he was deeply missed in Dalma, may God rest his soul. And as I was telling you, alhamdulillah all the family [ahl] are here in Dalma, especially your father, whenever I need anything, and so I haven’t really missed anything in Dalma [...] Alhamdulillah, my mission in Dalma, as a man specialized in archaeology, is to protect and preserve the artifacts in Dalma. If I was able to preserve or write a report, or on the simplest level, yesterday when the fence collapsed, and they were going to go in with tools and I refused –</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">[...]</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: So, you’ve followed up, mashallah –</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: I’ve followed up and I also made a report to the manager, they were going to put a net up and he stopped it from being put up, and said the new fence has to be like the old fence. And as the authority for archaeology, we partnered with him and we keep track of the work and oversee the work, so we try to keep tabs on everything and work with them.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: I mean, may God forgive the local authorities [baladiyya], their work and their perspective is always that [Dalma] should be like a modern city.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: And we have a different perspective because we care about the artifacts.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: You have to follow up.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Definitely, and alhamdulillah, the state is concerned with artifacts at the highest level and they’re seen as part of the heritage. Even Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed, may God prolong his life, is very concerned with artifacts. Anything relating to artifacts, if you were to take it to the diwan, they care a great deal about artifacts and historical buildings, and it’ll be under his own supervision. He’s the one who’ll send someone to the site to monitor and evaluate the work and the results.</div>",

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Alright sir, so how did you spend your time in Dalma? Both in the past and now. Especially since you have young kids, they definitely want to go out, and – </div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Wallahi, in Dalma the main resource we have available is the sea, and we would take advantage of the weekends and holidays… of course in the summer it was standard for them to go to the sea. They’d swim in the sea, shower in the sea, play [there]. An hour or two after asr they’d play in the sea. And sometimes, for example in the evenings, we’d go grill [have a barbeque] by the sea. The weather in Dalma is really beautiful in January, February, March… the weather is excellent then. So, we’d take some firewood and our friends and their families and sit by the sea and get [food] to grill, someone would bring meat, someone would bring fish, and we’d have dinner. So these were lovely days with the kids, with…</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Although there are some people on Dalma who complain that there aren’t things to do for fun in Dalma, but what I’ve noticed is that there are people who are able to have a good time and make their kids happy even if there aren’t activities like [those] in the cities.</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: I’m a firm believer that every person should engage with the environment they live in. Any environment. If you live in the desert, you engage with the desert. For instance, our ancestors, the Bedouins, would engage with the desert. What did they have? They had the tent and the camel and the herd, and they were living the best life, and they were satisfied [with this]. I live in Dalma because I’ve adapted to Dalma. What are the modes of entertainment I have here in Dalma? The sea. So, I can go to the sea, I can go to the gardens, I can go to the mountains and climb there, see the rocks. I’ve probably gone around every corner of Dalma, there’s not a spot I haven’t been to. For the sake of study and knowledge and work and culture. I even taught my kids how to examine [nature], for instance, what’s this stone? What color is it? “This stone is red,” or “this stone is green,” why is this one red and that one green? Why are these stones in Dalma? I fostered in my kids a love for mountains and the sea and studying [nature]. So, a person needs to adapt to the environment they live in. If I went, for example, to Abu Dhabi, I would also adapt myself to Abu Dhabi.</div>",

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: What about education? Did you learn in the mosque? Or school? </div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: I remember when we were young, there was a Sudanese doctor who had recently came to Delma.  His name was Dr. Darwish, and he asked us, “Do you know how to read and write?” We said no, so he would bring us carboard and charcoal, write letters and teach us, and I remember that he would reward us if we learned our lessons by taking us on a trip to a mountain called Qarn Al Safafeer so the whole group of children could play together.

<div class=""interviewOtherInfo"">Interviewer: Salama Al Qubaisi</div><div class='interviewOtherInfo'>Mr. Jumaa Khamis Al Qubaisi is a retired fisherman and community leader. He was born on Delma Island in 1948.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: How did you make a living in the past?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: We earned money selling fish. But before my time, in my parents’ time, people made more money from pearl diving and people were buying slaves for 5, 10, 20 rupees.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Slaves!?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, selling and buying slaves still existed until the era of Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, but then Britain prevented that and issued a decree to free them.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Is it right that the slaves took the family name of the man who bought them?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, for example, if I bought a slave then his/her family name would become Al Qubaisi. Many of their children are still living in Abu Dhabi.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: How were they treated?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: In fact, some people were treating them good but some were not and the system was if you buy a slave, you should provide food, residence and clothes for him/her. Also, some people married their slaves.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Did they give them a salary?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: No no. Owners only provided food, residence and clothes for them. If the owner decided to sell his slaves, he went to Buraimi market.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: I heard that Delma residents paid the government in the past. What was that?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: The government sent men to collect what was called “qalayet” and I remember one of these men was Abd Alqani. These men were taking “qulata” from each ship. They collected it like this: If my ship’s profit was 10,000 dirhams, I should pay the half to the sailors, and the “qulata” will be the same as one sailor takes, and in this example it is 1000 dirhams from me.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: So can we say that “qulata” was what we call taxes today?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, it was known in the other Gulf countries. It was also applied on dates. People who had date palms had to give the government an amount of the dates.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Was Delma considered as a source of income for the government?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, in the past the highest income was from Delma, and from pearl diving. Merchants and shipmasters also had weapons. So if there was a war or if the government needed their help, they stood with it. At the time, the government did not have a formal military, but people who had weapons stood with the government in good or bad and without hesitation.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: So the government was depending on merchants and shipmasters for an army?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, and the Bedouins also. If there was a war, they gave anything they could even if it was only a camel.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Do you remember the period of pearl diving?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: I remember the late diving period when oil was found in Kuwait, and people started to go there to work. And then it was found in Bahrain and people went to work there and stopped diving and selling pearls after the emergence of artificial pearls.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: But did the fish selling still exist?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we who stayed on Delma, we were still working in fish selling.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Was it a good income?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: It was not bad. It covered our expenses. We were getting 1000 to 1500 dirhams at the beginning per month, but people were satisfied.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were born 1948, what kind of developments do you remember in your childhood?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: I remember that I went with my family to AlHajj in 1955 by car!</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: So in that time you were not travelling by camels?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: No, when I was born there were cars.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were travelling to Al Ain in the summer, did you also go by car?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we were going by car. Oil had appeared in the early 1950s but was still in the beginning. For example, I remember Mr. Butti al-Qubaisi, who had worked on Das Island in the year 1961 or 1962, in the first steamship working on Das.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: How did you know about the jobs in oil companies?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Sheikh Shakhbout bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may God have mercy on him, knew that many people lived on Delma Island. He sent people to Delma and took those who wanted to work with the oil company to Das Island. They received 5 rupees a day and
worked in many jobs.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You lived a hard life!</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we lived hard days .The women went with their donkeys to bring water and somewent to bring the wood for cooking. The older women did the cooking at home, but we noticed that life was getting better day by day and everything was getting better. One of he blessings we have today is electricity. In the past, there was no electricity. We were using “Fanar” (lanterns). But before, in the pearl diving period, as our parents told us, they lived a good life.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Were the pearl diving and the good quality of life in Delma, the reasons why people started to come at that time?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, and many traders have come to Delma from Kuwait and Iraq.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: What period of time did Delma prosper?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: From the 1940s and earlier. And people of Delma were rich, each shipmaster had about 3 or 4 ships.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Was the owner of the ship the shipmaster on each trip?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Some of them were. But they also hired shipmasters. For example, Salem Bin Yaaed Al Qubaisi had five or six ships and he had hired other shipmasters.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: When they went out to dive, who stayed on the island with the women?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Some men stayed behind. The divers went in the summer and some of the people on Delma would go to Liwa, especially those who had palm trees there. They stayed there until the dates were ready and the divers came back. The divers would come ashore at Jabal Dhanah, and they would collect their families from Liwa and from Almarfaa, and those whose families were Abu Dhabi would bring them from Radeem. People who stayed in Delma depended only on fishing.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were saying that in the past the fish was plentiful and not like now!</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, in the past, we were fishing near the shore, only for our daily meals.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were not catching in large quantities like today?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: No, because there was no market for that like today. Also the ice was not available too much. Our sea was rich in fish, many ships from Bahrain, Qatar and Dubai were coming to our sea for fishing.</div>

<div class='interviewOtherInfo'>Narjes Saber Mohammed Hassan Al-Buhairi (known on Dalma island as Wafaa) is married to an Emirati man from Delma. She was born in Egypt circa 1960. This interview was conducted by Salama Jumaa Al Qubaisi on November 7, 2019.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Salama: You mentioned before that life was hard here in Dalma, what do you always remember about that?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Wafaa: Yes, it was hard. Sometimes I cried because of the hardness. I remember, for example, traveling to Abu Dhabi on the old ships (lanj). I was pregnant and it was winter, and I kept vomiting. Another time, I remember that we wanted to go to Abu Dhabi with our boat. My husband said, “We will go first to Gasha Island to collect bird’s eggs to take to people in Abu Dhabi.” After leaving that island, we lost the way and ran out of petrol. A big boat came to us and asked my husband about the problem, but they didn’t have enough petrol to give us. A man on the ship asked us about our destination, and when he knew that we wanted to go to Abu Dhabi he said: “This way will take you to Iran. Take that way. If the Iranian people catch you, they will put you in hot water.” That was during the war between Iraq and Iran. We went with the flow, and we slept that night on the boat with no food and water. The second day we saw the borders of Saadiyat Island, and we saw three men on a boat and we waved  for them until they reached and helped us. I was very happy, and I was crying because it was a very hard night.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Salama: That is very risky. How did people travel by their own boats without any permissions?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Wafaa: Yes, in that time there were no permissions and laws like today. Anyone could just go anywhere with their boats.</div>"

<div class=""interviewOtherInfo"">Interviewer: Salama Al Qubaisi</div>
<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">Interview Part 1:</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Mashallah, sir. So, when you came here in 1993, I mean, this is considered a very long time ago.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Yes.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: This was considered the beginning of Dalma’s advancement, with the schools and growing population. What are the most important differences that you’ve noticed in Dalma?</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Wallahi, the differences begin… when I came from Sharjah to Dalma, it was my first time on a boat.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes. But don’t you have boats in Egypt?</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: There are boats but they’re mainly for the touristic islands and such, so you wouldn’t ride a boat unless you were a tourist or worked on an island, or in Nile-based or sea-based tourism. Anyway, when I came, we left from Sharjah and reached Jabal Dhanna around 12 or 1 pm, we were on the ferry, or they used to call it al dooba back then.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes, al dooba, correct.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fatiha: so al dooba or the ferry travelled for around 3.5 hours from Jabal Dhanna to Dalma, and it was the first time I rode a boat through the sea and came to Dalma Island. And one of the developments on Dalma [has been] the mode of transportation, it used to be a ferry, then it became a hovercraft, which was replaced by a faster hovercraft, and the modes of transportation are modern now. That’s the first thing. Another is that back then, the streets weren’t lit, whereas today they are. And as for schools, there’s development in the schools. So alhamdulillah Dalma has developed as an island between 1993 and 2000 and… is it 2020 now? There’s been a lot of development alhamdulillah thanks to the sheikhs because they care about Dalma Island across all aspects.</div>
<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">Fathi’s memories from Dalma:</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Mashallah, this a great amount of time. Did any specific events happen to you, for example, that you can’t forget or that you think of when you think of Dalma?</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Of course, I’ve experienced a lot in Dalma, and I feel like all of the events [that stand out] have to do with the sea. I remember one time my wife wanted to work as a geography teacher and so she applied to work in the Ministry of Education, and back then the exam was in Dubai. And back then the boat in Dalma would depart once in the morning and come back in the afternoon.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Only.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: It wouldn’t leave again; it was just one time. Anyway, they called us from Dubai and told us you need to be here tomorrow morning at 8 am. And I didn’t have any means of transport and it was just our luck that the wind started blowing from the north on Dalma. And she wanted to get a job and go to the exam in Dubai and so I kept thinking and asking the people in Dalma how can I leave? They told me you have no choice but to take a tarad. </div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama; Oh God.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: And because I didn’t know the state of the sea… I knew that the wind was blowing from the north and that the northern wind is strong and carries you for a long while. Anyway, back then I had one daughter, Aliyah, now she’s grown and married alhamdulillah, she was young then, 5 months old.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: She was so young!</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: She was young, yes. So, I took my wife and we took the cooler and we went out to the sea. We sailed for around 10 minutes and of course when I looked at my wife I saw her tears were falling and she was crying. She told me, “Where are you taking us? Are you going to get me a job or are you going to kill us?”</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes. [laughs]</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: I told her “you’re not going to die, tomorrow you’ll be hired, and as a manager at that.”</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Subhanallah. [laughs]</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: So, we decided, subhanallah after all this fear, the waves were high and my wife was crying and the girl was crying, it was the toughest moment I’ve been through, so we decided alhamdullilah to go back from the sea to Dalma. And from that day I decided I wouldn’t get my wife hired.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: [laughs]</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: I wouldn’t look for a job or look for anything, we agreed that alhamdulillah [my] income was enough for us and the kids, and we became content, and alhamdulillah to this day my wife stays [contentedly] at home without a job, doing whatever she wants. She didn’t have to get a job to provide.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Mashallah.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: So, this is one sense. And in other aspects, alhamdullilah, things are good in Dalma.</div>
<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">Interview Part 3:</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Yeah, the water was available, and so agriculture was available. And pearl diving was available. And fishing was available. It also served as a transit station; people who travelled would stop by Dalma. There’s this really nice story about a queen who chose to spend her honeymoon on Dalma.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Subhanallah.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Yeah, she chose to live on Dalma. This was maybe 7000 years ago, the king’s name was Sargon of Akkad [Al Akkadi], from the Akkadian empire. His daughter said, “I want to live on an island,” and back then they called pearls ‘the flower of life.’ When a diver would turn up with pearls, they thought he’d live longer, they believed that pearls would extend their lives. So, Dalma was famous for pearls. This was 7000 or 8000 years ago. And like we said, back then it was a heaven of the heart, all these years ago, before construction and the creation of the communes. So, she [the queen] had gotten married and asked to live with her husband where? In Dalma.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes. Today people go all the way to the Maldives, and she had asked to go to Dalma.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Exactly, subhanallah. So, in Dalma life was good and the water was also good and life as a whole was excellent.</div>

<div class=""interviewOtherInfo"">Interviewer: Salama Al Qubaisi</div>
<div class=""subHeaderInterview"">Fathi on Delma’s Farms</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Wallahi, Dalma has… in terms of the mountains, from a geological perspective, Dalma is very old, over millions of years old, back to the Cambrian Period. So, as a study, Dalma is an ancient island that existed since the Cambrian Period. In it [Dalma], there are six minerals. The most important of them, they call it in khaleeji dialect al maghara. Its scientific name is hematite. Another mineral we have here is something called quartz, as well as metal [indiscernible], and something called halite. There’s also jiri stones [limestone] and jabali [mountain] stones, so there’s a number of different minerals in Dalma.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: And even, back in the day, Dalma, because of how important it was, the materials on it were used as fertilizer. They would take the water and soil from Dalma, the soil in Dalma was very pure so it was used as a substitute for fertilizer in agriculture. So [minerals] are very abundant in Dalma, there are around six or seven types of minerals in the mountains, from a scientific perspective. And [the island] is very old and goes back to the Cambrian Period. Here, there are two opposing opinions. Some people say Dalma is a volcanic island [jazira borkaniya] and some say it’s a salt island [jazira malhiya], that it was formed out of salts from the sea. So these are the two main opinions, each one has its evidence, and they’re both close to the truth.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Yes. So, sir, was the soil in Dalma suitable for agriculture?</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Yes, it was. Dalma used to export its soil.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: This is the first time I’ve heard of this, it used to export the soil, but we didn’t see any agriculture on [Dalma] until Sheikh Zayed gave instructions for it, may God rest his soul.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Dalma, back in the day, they called it a heaven of the heart. [janna men el janan] Back in the day people didn’t care about agriculture, back in the day, the morning after it rained, you’d see mountains and [it felt] like you’d never seen mountains before. The edge [of the island] was greenery, it was a heaven of the heart. Of course, every era, the weather and climate change, the rain decreases, the rain increases, but they say back in the day there were heavy rains in Dalma and after it rained the mountains and Dalma would transform into a heaven. Because of all the agriculture, the soil was mineral and very pure on Dalma island.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Subhanallah. Yes, my dad used to say that in the past they didn’t tend to the cattle in the mountains, but now they spend a lot of money just to buy them food and grass [for grazing.]</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: I mean, yes, look at the difference. The grazing was natural, now it’s artificial and bought from the farms. So Dalma was excellent, it had minerals and its water was good and the land was rich.</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Delma Island’s main source of income after the end of the pearl industry was fishing. It remained a vital part of the economy until the end of the twentieth century, when the majority of the working age population became educated and moved to Abu Dhabi to higher paying jobs. Today, there is still a fishing industry, but the fishermen are from India, although the boats are owned and operated by Emirati residents. It is a smaller industry than it was before. The main way of catching fish is the garghoor, the net cage you can see the fisherman in this video making. These garghoor have caused environmental issues and are strictly limited by the government due to overfishing.  Before the ghargoor, fishing was done with meskar, a cage made of stone. Each fisherman had his own location to place his meskar.  But as three Emirati men in their early 30s  shared with NYUAD students in 2017, trust doesn’t exist anymore, as the majority of the fishermen are not connected directly to families on the island and will take another man’s net haul as his own catch. The young Emirati men told the students that they think fishing is still culturally important to the people of Delma, even though they all work in Abu Dhabi as engineers and accountants. </div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: No, let me tell you. I’ve lived in Dalma and I love its people, I love everyone [here]. And their manners… and I don’t say this out of hypocrisy, I swear, I mean I’m at the last stage of my life, so I’m being sincere. Dalma is one family. I’ve never seen someone here think they’re better than someone else or someone hurt by someone else. Even when I go to your father’s, he has the majlis open, and so anyone who wants to have dinner, this is the excellent social side of things. He gathers people around him at night as one family, and you don’t even necessarily have to be a citizen, you can be an expat, you can be Syrian, Egyptian, khaleeji, Emirati… everyone gathers at his house and we sit together at night. So, there are wonderful traditions in Dalma that maybe the people of Dalma don’t even feel.</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: They’re used to it.</div>
<div class=""answerTranscript"">Fathi: Yes, they’re used to it. And it’s the kindness and the good character and the togetherness of families.

<div class=""interviewOtherInfoNoMarginBottom"">Date: 1/6/2020</div>
<div class=""interviewOtherInfo"">Interviewer: Salama Al Qubaisi</div>
<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Bint Saeed, tell us about weddings. Do you remember how your wedding was?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, I remember. On the day of my wedding, I was standing at the window and seeing men of Pakistani nationality dancing in the outdoor yard of our house.</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Who was playing music and singing at that time?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Anyone who can sing can participate and sing or just play the cassette recorder, and there was still no known art of Hubban, as it came to Delma in the eighties.</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Was the wedding celebration really extended for a week as it is said?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, in the past, people used to do everything and pay attention to the smallest details related to the wedding, and everyone participated in that, and it used to extend for seven days during which the sheep were slaughtered, the rice was prepared, the harees was cooked, and lunch and dinner distributed to everyone.</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: How old were you when you got married?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Between fourteen and fifteen. Most women were married at this age, so even my mother got married at about that age. I remember after I gave birth to my first daughter, it had not been even 40 days after giving birth, my brother was getting married and it was the first day of Ramadan, but I could not attend the wedding because in the past they believed that a woman after giving birth and before completing 40 days would be inauspicious. If she attended any wedding during that period, it might cause the bride to be unable to conceive in the future.</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: Was it allowed to celebrate weddings in Ramadan?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, in the past, everything continues to happen during Ramadan. The families prepare the food and distribute it at Iftar time.</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama: What was preparing the bride like in those days?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: In the past the groom used to instruct his female family members to supply the bride with everything. I remember that my husband told his cousins that he was getting married and he gave them a sum of money and they bought everything for me-- all kinds of gold (Manthoora, Kawashy, Ma’aded and rings), and they put it in a special bag for gold. In those days, Mr. Rashid bin Fahad would bring from India women’s fabrics called Mizarrai and they bought me about eight pieces of them and also bought me cotton fabrics and they sewed them for me. They bought me everything from clothes, shoes, toiletries and perfumes and put them in big bags for me.</div>

<div class=""questionTranscript"">Salama:  So the groom's family were the ones who previously bought everything for the bride?</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, at the time of the marriage contract, the groom puts an amount of money called (Sabaha). Some put in 10,000 or 15,000 dirhams, each according to his ability.  Then his family bought with this amount everything for the bride. In addition to that, they bought fabrics for women and men that were distributed to the families of the neighborhood as a gift from the bride, a gift is placed for each family that includes a piece of cloth for the woman and a piece of cloth for the man, and sometimes a ghutra is added for the man.</div>


<div class=""questionTranscript"">[...]</div>

<div class=""answerTranscript"">Aisha: Yes, in the past, even if the wedding was simple, it was blessed. Everyone would be happy if there was a wedding, and they wouldn’t cook at their homes. When it was time for lunch or dinner, each of them would take his or her plate and go to take from the wedding meal. Everyone participated in cooking and eating as well, and they used to cook for them for three days. But that has changed, as most people have their weddings in Abu Dhabi now.</div>
