He was born on Delma Island in 1948.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: How did you make a living in the past?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: We earned money selling fish. But before my time, in my parents’ time, people made more money from pearl diving and people were buying slaves for 5, 10, 20 rupees.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Slaves!?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, selling and buying slaves still existed until the era of Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, but then Britain prevented that and issued a decree to free them.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Is it right that the slaves took the family name of the man who bought them?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, for example, if I bought a slave then his/her family name would become Al Qubaisi. Many of their children are still living in Abu Dhabi.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: How were they treated?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: In fact, some people were treating them good but some were not and the system was if you buy a slave, you should provide food, residence and clothes for him/her. Also, some people married their slaves.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Did they give them a salary?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: No no. Owners only provided food, residence and clothes for them. If the owner decided to sell his slaves, he went to Buraimi market.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: I heard that Delma residents paid the government in the past. What was that?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: The government sent men to collect what was called “qalayet” and I remember one of these men was Abd Alqani. These men were taking “qulata” from each ship. They collected it like this: If my ship’s profit was 10,000 dirhams, I should pay the half to the sailors, and the “qulata” will be the same as one sailor takes, and in this example it is 1000 dirhams from me.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: So can we say that “qulata” was what we call taxes today?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, it was known in the other Gulf countries. It was also applied on dates. People who had date palms had to give the government an amount of the dates.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Was Delma considered as a source of income for the government?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, in the past the highest income was from Delma, and from pearl diving. Merchants and shipmasters also had weapons. So if there was a war or if the government needed their help, they stood with it. At the time, the government did not have a formal military, but people who had weapons stood with the government in good or bad and without hesitation.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: So the government was depending on merchants and shipmasters for an army?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, and the Bedouins also. If there was a war, they gave anything they could even if it was only a camel.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Do you remember the period of pearl diving?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: I remember the late diving period when oil was found in Kuwait, and people started to go there to work. And then it was found in Bahrain and people went to work there and stopped diving and selling pearls after the emergence of artificial pearls.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: But did the fish selling still exist?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we who stayed on Delma, we were still working in fish selling.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Was it a good income?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: It was not bad. It covered our expenses. We were getting 1000 to 1500 dirhams at the beginning per month, but people were satisfied.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: You were born 1948, what kind of developments do you remember in your childhood?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: I remember that I went with my family to AlHajj in 1955 by car!</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: So in that time you were not travelling by camels?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: No, when I was born there were cars.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: You were travelling to Al Ain in the summer, did you also go by car?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we were going by car. Oil had appeared in the early 1950s but was still in the beginning. For example, I remember Mr. Butti al-Qubaisi, who had worked on Das Island in the year 1961 or 1962, in the first steamship working on Das.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: How did you know about the jobs in oil companies?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Sheikh Shakhbout bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may God have mercy on him, knew that many people lived on Delma Island. He sent people to Delma and took those who wanted to work with the oil company to Das Island. They received 5 rupees a day and
worked in many jobs.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: You lived a hard life!</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we lived hard days .The women went with their donkeys to bring water and somewent to bring the wood for cooking. The older women did the cooking at home, but we noticed that life was getting better day by day and everything was getting better. One of he blessings we have today is electricity. In the past, there was no electricity. We were using “Fanar” (lanterns). But before, in the pearl diving period, as our parents told us, they lived a good life.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Were the pearl diving and the good quality of life in Delma, the reasons why people started to come at that time?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, and many traders have come to Delma from Kuwait and Iraq.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: What period of time did Delma prosper?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: From the 1940s and earlier. And people of Delma were rich, each shipmaster had about 3 or 4 ships.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: Was the owner of the ship the shipmaster on each trip?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Some of them were. But they also hired shipmasters. For example, Salem Bin Yaaed Al Qubaisi had five or six ships and he had hired other shipmasters.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: When they went out to dive, who stayed on the island with the women?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Some men stayed behind. The divers went in the summer and some of the people on Delma would go to Liwa, especially those who had palm trees there. They stayed there until the dates were ready and the divers came back. The divers would come ashore at Jabal Dhanah, and they would collect their families from Liwa and from Almarfaa, and those whose families were Abu Dhabi would bring them from Radeem. People who stayed in Delma depended only on fishing.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: You were saying that in the past the fish was plentiful and not like now!</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, in the past, we were fishing near the shore, only for our daily meals.</div>
<div className='questionTranscript'>Q: You were not catching in large quantities like today?</div>
<div className='answerTranscript'>A: No, because there was no market for that like today. Also the ice was not available too much. Our sea was rich in fish, many ships from Bahrain, Qatar and Dubai were coming to our sea for fishing.</div>"
