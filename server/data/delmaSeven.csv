<div class='interviewOtherInfo'>Fathi Mohammed Abdullah is an Egyptian curator and archaeologist of the Delma Museum. This interview occurred in January 2020.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: First of all, I want to thank your father (Jumaa Al Qubaisi) and Rashid Al Mazroui. A lot of people in Delma helped us (write the history). There was no recorded history. There was no clear information about Delma’s history. Information was very scarce. So I would do research in libraries, and still there wasn’t much, but I could find what others had written about Delma. So when I met your father and Rashid Al Mazouie, they were able to tell me what Delma was like in the past and I was able to piece the real story together and find information to support it.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: Yes, that’s what we want to discuss. The real information. We don’t want anybody just saying anything.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: Thank God, we have been able to review and verify our information several times.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: Yes, very rigorously.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: Now we have more than 100 documents. They talk about Delma and the secrets of Delma and so on.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: Ok, teacher, first tell me when you came to Delma. Had you ever heard of Abu Dhabi or the Emirates?</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: My story about coming here is random. I first came to work in Sharjah. I spent a month in Sharjah. This is in 1993. June to be precise. I had a boss, Abdul Sitar Al Aazawi. He told us there was a project on Delma. With the Department of Works, which was based in Abu Dhabi. So this was in July 1993. The Department of Works was under Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed, God rest his soul. When I arrived in Delma, Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed was in charge of everything on the island. We were a small group. There was our group leader Nasser Al Aboudi, who was originally from Sharjah. We also had two citizens from Sharjah. And they would all come to Delma for a week, then go back to Sharjah for a week, like that. I was the only one who resided full-time on Delma.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: So can we say you were the first employee on Delma from the Department of Culture?</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: In Delma, yes. I wrote three or four papers about archaeology but no one was really interested in the topic at first. Archaeology back then was part of the Department of Works.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: You mean there was no Department of Culture then?</div>

<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: No, there was really nothing about heritage or archaeology then at all… But thanks to Sultan bin Zayed, the most active place for archaeology was the Department of Works…and we started working on building the history of Delma with the museum. There was very little history then. There was this place, Bait Al Mouraikhi, which is now the museum, and the three mosques. I started working on designing the museum right when I came here. We used photos to recreate what it would look like. And Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed cared about every step and he was always consulting with Sheikh Zayed for approval. So planning the design took a year.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: So it was very precise.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: Everything in the place had to be approved by Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed. Everything that was old, we tried to take care of and keep. Even the little things on the wall. We took a lot of photos and we made copies of them. So we recreated them, including some of the fixtures in the mosques.</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Salama: Mashallah.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Fathi: If you had seen the Mouraikhi house before, it looked more like a garden. If you look at the old photos, it was all trees. There were so many trees surrounding it, you couldn’t even see a house. I mean there were trees growing inside the house. So with precise, scientific work, we were able to do it and to remove the trees in and around the house and recreate the house in full. We had around 3,000 photos to do this job.</div>",

<div class='interviewOtherInfo'>Mr. Jumaa Khamis Al Qubaisi is a retired fisherman and community leader. He was born on Delma Island in 1948.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: How did you make a living in the past?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: We earned money selling fish. But before my time, in my parents’ time, people made more money from pearl diving and people were buying slaves for 5, 10, 20 rupees.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Slaves!?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, selling and buying slaves still existed until the era of Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, but then Britain prevented that and issued a decree to free them.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Is it right that the slaves took the family name of the man who bought them?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, for example, if I bought a slave then his/her family name would become Al Qubaisi. Many of their children are still living in Abu Dhabi.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: How were they treated?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: In fact, some people were treating them good but some were not and the system was if you buy a slave, you should provide food, residence and clothes for him/her. Also, some people married their slaves.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Did they give them a salary?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: No no. Owners only provided food, residence and clothes for them. If the owner decided to sell his slaves, he went to Buraimi market.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: I heard that Delma residents paid the government in the past. What was that?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: The government sent men to collect what was called “qalayet” and I remember one of these men was Abd Alqani. These men were taking “qulata” from each ship. They collected it like this: If my ship’s profit was 10,000 dirhams, I should pay the half to the sailors, and the “qulata” will be the same as one sailor takes, and in this example it is 1000 dirhams from me.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: So can we say that “qulata” was what we call taxes today?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, it was known in the other Gulf countries. It was also applied on dates. People who had date palms had to give the government an amount of the dates.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Was Delma considered as a source of income for the government?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, in the past the highest income was from Delma, and from pearl diving. Merchants and shipmasters also had weapons. So if there was a war or if the government needed their help, they stood with it. At the time, the government did not have a formal military, but people who had weapons stood with the government in good or bad and without hesitation.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: So the government was depending on merchants and shipmasters for an army?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, and the Bedouins also. If there was a war, they gave anything they could even if it was only a camel.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Do you remember the period of pearl diving?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: I remember the late diving period when oil was found in Kuwait, and people started to go there to work. And then it was found in Bahrain and people went to work there and stopped diving and selling pearls after the emergence of artificial pearls.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: But did the fish selling still exist?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we who stayed on Delma, we were still working in fish selling.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Was it a good income?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: It was not bad. It covered our expenses. We were getting 1000 to 1500 dirhams at the beginning per month, but people were satisfied.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were born 1948, what kind of developments do you remember in your childhood?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: I remember that I went with my family to AlHajj in 1955 by car!</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: So in that time you were not travelling by camels?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: No, when I was born there were cars.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were travelling to Al Ain in the summer, did you also go by car?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we were going by car. Oil had appeared in the early 1950s but was still in the beginning. For example, I remember Mr. Butti al-Qubaisi, who had worked on Das Island in the year 1961 or 1962, in the first steamship working on Das.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: How did you know about the jobs in oil companies?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Sheikh Shakhbout bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may God have mercy on him, knew that many people lived on Delma Island. He sent people to Delma and took those who wanted to work with the oil company to Das Island. They received 5 rupees a day and
worked in many jobs.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You lived a hard life!</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, we lived hard days .The women went with their donkeys to bring water and somewent to bring the wood for cooking. The older women did the cooking at home, but we noticed that life was getting better day by day and everything was getting better. One of he blessings we have today is electricity. In the past, there was no electricity. We were using “Fanar” (lanterns). But before, in the pearl diving period, as our parents told us, they lived a good life.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Were the pearl diving and the good quality of life in Delma, the reasons why people started to come at that time?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, and many traders have come to Delma from Kuwait and Iraq.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: What period of time did Delma prosper?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: From the 1940s and earlier. And people of Delma were rich, each shipmaster had about 3 or 4 ships.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: Was the owner of the ship the shipmaster on each trip?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Some of them were. But they also hired shipmasters. For example, Salem Bin Yaaed Al Qubaisi had five or six ships and he had hired other shipmasters.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: When they went out to dive, who stayed on the island with the women?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Some men stayed behind. The divers went in the summer and some of the people on Delma would go to Liwa, especially those who had palm trees there. They stayed there until the dates were ready and the divers came back. The divers would come ashore at Jabal Dhanah, and they would collect their families from Liwa and from Almarfaa, and those whose families were Abu Dhabi would bring them from Radeem. People who stayed in Delma depended only on fishing.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were saying that in the past the fish was plentiful and not like now!</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: Yes, in the past, we were fishing near the shore, only for our daily meals.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Q: You were not catching in large quantities like today?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>A: No, because there was no market for that like today. Also the ice was not available too much. Our sea was rich in fish, many ships from Bahrain, Qatar and Dubai were coming to our sea for fishing.</div>
","<div class='interviewHeader'>Interview with Narjes Saber Mohammed Hassan Al-Buhairi</div>
<div class='interviewOtherInfo'>Narjes Saber Mohammed Hassan Al-Buhairi (known on Dalma island as Wafaa) is married to an Emirati man from Delma. She was born in Egypt circa 1960. This interview was conducted by Salama Jumaa Al Qubaisi on November 7, 2019.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Salama: You mentioned before that life was hard here in Dalma, what do you always remember about that?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Wafaa: Yes, it was hard. Sometimes I cried because of the hardness. I remember, for example, traveling to Abu Dhabi on the old ships (lanj). I was pregnant and it was winter, and I kept vomiting. Another time, I remember that we wanted to go to Abu Dhabi with our boat. My husband said, “We will go first to Gasha Island to collect bird’s eggs to take to people in Abu Dhabi.” After leaving that island, we lost the way and ran out of petrol. A big boat came to us and asked my husband about the problem, but they didn’t have enough petrol to give us. A man on the ship asked us about our destination, and when he knew that we wanted to go to Abu Dhabi he said: “This way will take you to Iran. Take that way. If the Iranian people catch you, they will put you in hot water.” That was during the war between Iraq and Iran. We went with the flow, and we slept that night on the boat with no food and water. The second day we saw the borders of Saadiyat Island, and we saw three men on a boat and we waved  for them until they reached and helped us. I was very happy, and I was crying because it was a very hard night.</div>
<div class='questionTranscript'>Salama: That is very risky. How did people travel by their own boats without any permissions?</div>
<div class='answerTranscript'>Wafaa: Yes, in that time there were no permissions and laws like today. Anyone could just go anywhere with their boats.</div>"

It remained a vital part of the economy until the end of the twentieth century, when the majority of the working age population became educated and moved to Abu Dhabi to higher paying jobs. Today, there is still a fishing industry, but the fishermen are from India, although the boats are owned and operated by Emirati residents. It is a smaller industry than it was before. The main way of catching fish is the garghoor, the net cage you can see the fisherman in this video making. These garghoor have caused environmental issues and are strictly limited by the government due to overfishing.  Before the ghargoor, fishing was done with meskar, a cage made of stone. Each fisherman had his own location to place his meskar.  But as three Emirati men in their early 30s  shared with NYUAD students in 2017, trust doesn’t exist anymore, as the majority of the fishermen are not connected directly to families on the island and will take another man’s net haul as his own catch. The young Emirati men told the students that they think fishing is still culturally important to the people of Delma, even though they all work in Abu Dhabi as engineers and accountants.</div>
